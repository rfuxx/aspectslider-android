# aspectslider-android
Show a slideshow of pictures with mixed aspect ratios, and use the empty screenspace for sliding in/out next/previous images

## What this is
- A viewer to show some pictures as a "calm" slideshow
- My first Android app, so please bear with me if I should have got anything significanty wrong

## What this is not
- A tool to quickly flick through your pictures by swiping

## What is the special idea about it?
Special? Not really. I just have some photo series with mixed landscape portrait pictures, and I find it cumbersome to always turn the phone/tablet around to show them in optimal size. On the other hand I do not like all the blank screenspace when the device's orientation if different from the picture's, so I wondered what it would look like if the empty screenspace would rather be used to show (parts of) further images from the series, and I think I like this look now :-)
